Homework 5 : Flocking
IGME 202.02 Fall 2015

User functionality: None

Reasoning behind design choices - I used a lot of the placeholders from my final project, so that I was almost working on that
at the same time.

The deer flock a little loosely to try to allow them to avoid obstacles, so there is a set radius from the centroid that they can deviate from without
being corrected by the cohesion force. The trees actually aren'te ven objects at this point, they're all billboards, so they aren't
being avoided. The obstacles are the little white chests.
The weighting is still incredibly imperfect, I spent hours on it but at the end of the day I just ran out of time to continue fiddling.
So sometimes strange things happen or they run into the chests.

Requirements not completed: I did everything, but the weighting part is not great. 

The flocking methods are all in Flocker.cs, the regular autonomous agent methods are in Vehicle.cs.
